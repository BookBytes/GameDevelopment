    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
    Due to the complexity involved in developing games, game engines have become standard in the video game industry. 
    By providing an intuitive interface and comprehensive layers of abstraction, game designers and developers can focus on the important parts of development. 
    <span class="stress">
        For our second project, we will use the <a href="http://unity3d.com">Unity Engine</a> to produce games that can run on any platform and with a variety of control schemes. 
    </span>
