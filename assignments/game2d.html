<h1>Introduction to Game Development</h1>
<h2>2D Game Group Project</h2>
</div>

<p>In a <a href="#teams">team</a>, you will develop a full 2D game using Python and PyGame under a scenario that is comparable to a real-world working environment.  The more original your game is, the better.  There is no limit to the genre of the game but there are constraints:</p>

<ol>
<li>The game must be more sophisticated than just <span class="title">Pong</span> or <span class="title">Space Invaders</span>!</li>
<li>My image cannot be used as a sprite or character in the game.</li>
<li>Images must be used.</li>
<li>Chiptunes must be used and it is the only acceptable form of sound/audio.</li>
<li>Game must have a storyline.</li>
<li>The game must be playable using a USB joystick or joypad in addition to the keyboard and mouse/trackpad</li>
<li>The game must be playable on a Raspberry Pi.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Deliverables</h2>
<p>There are five deliverables for this project (the check-in shall count as a deliverable):</p>
<ol>
<li><span class="def">Project Proposal (5 points; due Tuesday, February 18th; hand in at beginning of class; one submission per group)</span> - Must be no longer than one page typed.</li>
<li><span class="def">Game Design Document (25 points; due Tuesday, February 25th; hand in at beginning of class; one submission per group)</span> - Outline format is preferred.  The proposal must include:
<ul>
<li>Title of the game</li>
<li>Brief overview of storyline</li>
<li>Description of the game</li>
<li>Challenge(s)</li>
<li>Core features</li>
<li>Secondary features</li>
<li>Game mechanics (including interaction, colors, data)</li>
<li>Game economy</li>
<li>Game balance</li>
<li>Victory and defeat conditions</li>
<li>Mockup screenshots <span class="note">(drawn electronically only)</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span class="def">A Working Game (15 points check-in on Thursday, March 13th in class; 35 points for working game with <code>README</code> document due on Thursday, March 27th in class)</span> - Written in Python and PyGame. <span class="note">Source code must be in a GitHub repository (that I will assign).</span></li>
<li><span class="def">Test Plan (20 points; due Thursday, April 3rd in class; one submission per group)</span>.  This document will be distributed to all students (a.k.a., players) in the class.  This document shall have the following sections:
<ol>
<li>Game title (duh!)</li>
<li>Authors (your name; duh!)</li>
<li>Description of game in 255 words or less</li>
<li>Brief instructions (rules)</li>
<li>Controls (for every control scheme in your game)</li>
<li>A checklist of at least 5 tasks that you want the player to test with a section for comments.  Briefly describe each task with proper outcome.  Example: press a key 5 times =&gt; produces a special move</li>
<li>Section for additional comments and suggestions</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>

<h2>Assessment</h2>
<p>Your game will be assessment on five factors:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="def">Functionality</span> - I am looking for a game that works and is playable.  Remember, a game with fewer features that work is significantly better than a game with numerous features, where some either do not work or are buggy.</li>
<li><span class="def">Production</span> - I am looking for a game that is polished (e.g., graphics and sound), consistent (e.g., look-and-feel), and reasonably professional.</li>
<li><span class="def">Complexity</span> - The more original your game is, the better.  Things that will increase the complexity of your game: realistic collisions, some AI, landscapes, sound, etc.</li>
<li><span class="def">Game Design</span> - Is your game fun?  Is your user interface easy to understand?  Is there good game balance (i.e., not too easy, not too hard)?</li>
<li><span class="def">Technical Competency</span> - Use good programming practices, source code in a GitHub repository</li>
</ul>
