<h3>Keywords</h3>
<ul>
<li>Quality Assurance (QA) - the professional term for testing</li>
<li>Bug - A software problem that exists in the implementation-level (i.e. only exist in source code)</li>
<li>Flaw - A software problem at a much deeper level, particularly in the design, and likely in the code level</li>
<li>System testing - Test the individual game components; internal to group</li>
<li>Play testing - Primarily done among development team, product and marketing managers</li>
<li>Alpha - In general, refers to the fact that everything has been implemented, but there are many bugs and gameplay/functionality issues; wide audience among senior personnel in company</li>
<li>Beta - In general, refers to the fact that everything has been implemented, and many critical gameplay/functionality issues and bugs have been resolved (but there are small bugs still lingering); even wider audience, nearly public</li>
</ul>

<h3>What I Learned in the Real World</h3>
<ul>
<li>Look, no software is perfect, and all software have problems</li>
<li>Why is software is not perfect, and why is software getting more difficult to make and manage?
<ul>
<li>Complexity</li>
<li>Extensibility</li>
<li>Connectivity</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It would be nice to "find and fix all bugs," but it is largely wishful thinking (many constraints)</li>
<li>You don't want to find and fix all bugs, but you do want to find and fix the embarrassing and critical ones (before the CEO or senior management finds them)!</li>
<li>Testing often done very late in the integration process (right before rollout)</li>
<li>Unfortunately, testing can be a thankless and underappreciated job.  The reasons behind the negativity:
<ul>
<li>You will most likely tick-off the engineers and programmers when you find bugs, and tell him/her to fix them</li>
<li>Because testing is done so late in the integration process, a lot of known and found bugs will not be resolved in time because the product needs to be shipped (i.e. lack of impact of testers).  This is a very poor practice.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Many "agree" that testing should be tightly incorporated in the development phase (but few actually do it)</li>
<li>Personally, I feel that it is necessary to incorporate testing early in the development, if not, design phase.  That is why I decided to talk about testing now rather than near the end of the course to stress the importance of testing.</li>
<li>Skills required for the job:
<ul>
<li>Excellent oral communication - You will interact with the developers!  You need to explain things clearly, and use good English.</li>
<li>Excellent written communication - Developers must to able to comprehend and recreate the problem</li>
<li>Tech and game-savvy - You must be able to play the game, and navigate through the product, largely on your own with minimal instructions</li>
<li>Endurance - You must be able to work on a project for a long time.  You will likely have to work long hours, especially during crunch time (12 - 15 hours a day is not uncommon).  Finally, you will have to do a lot of repetitive and mundane work: like playing an unfinished game over and over again, installing software, adding/removing hardware.</li>
<li>Good attitude - Being a game tester is a "foot-in-the-door" to the industry, but it will lead to bigger and better things if you are good and upbeat (e.g. promotion to a lead position very quickly, or move to be a developer)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>QA infrastructure: 1 QA personnel for approximately every 3 developer (many game companies have 15 - 20, or more, personnel on the QA team)</li>
</ul>

<h3>General Defect Tracking</h3>
<ul>
<li>Reporting your bugs</li>
<li>Many commercial defect tracking systems (databases)</li>
<li>Your report must be descriptive and concise for the developers to recreate and fix the problem (that is why your written communication skills are so critical)</li>
<li>The types of bugs that you report (severity):
<ul>
<li>Showstopper - These bugs must be fixed immediate or the skies will fall (e.g. glaring problems including audio glitches, game crashes, missing features, etc.).  Consequences include: bad press, poor sales, people getting fired, and a black mark to the company's name.</li>
<li>Serious - Problems that gamers will likely notice, but does not take away from the gameplay experience (thus, can hold off)</li>
<li>Intermediate - Ditto</li>
<li>Low - Not so glaring problems that can be fixed in the next revision or patch</li>
<li>Suggestion - Changes or features that would be nice to have</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other pertinent fields in a bug report:
<ul>
<li>Reported on date</li>
<li>Report by (your name)</li>
<li>Assigned to</li>
<li>Feature</li>
<li>Description</li>
<li>Build / version</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Assigned to developer will take a look into the problem, and will add to the report:
<ul>
<li>Status: {Open, Closed, Resolved, Not a bug, Cannot replicate}</li>
<li>Resolved on date</li>
<li>Resolution method</li>
<li>Assigned to (another developer)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>After bug has been resolved, tester must verify the fix</li>
<li>It is possible that some bugs are actually not bugs</li>
<li>It is not uncommon to reopen a bug case</li>
</ul>

<h3>Regression Testing</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you have a plan to test a set of features, and changes and bugfixes are made, you have to go back and retest everything (the set of features) from the start</li>
<li>Important if you have a patch to be released for the game</li>
<li>Quite common that new bugfixes and changes introduce new bugs!</li>
<li>Very loopy process</li>
</ul>

<h3>Focus (Usability) Testing</h3>
<ul>
<li>Very different from QA testing</li>
<li>Not necessarily trying to find bugs</li>
<li>What you are testing:
<ul>
<li>Ease of use</li>
<li>Interface design</li>
<li>Can you perform a certain task</li>
<li>Fun</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Can take place in the design phase or in the integration phase
<ul>
<li>In the design phase, use low-tech mockups to see how users would do a certain task, which would aide the design of the task in the actual game</li>
<li>In the integration phase, players actually play the game, and perform a list of tasks details on a test plan (checklist)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Evaluation
<ul>
<li>Usability testing should be conducted by someone who is not a developer (no knowledge of the game, thus no influence on testing)</li>
<li>Subjects should also have no knowledge about the game</li>
<li>Subjects must be carefully monitored, and all actions documented by evaluator/interviewer (i.e. note where the subject was confused, mouse and key presses)</li>
<li>Subjects are encouraged to think aloud</li>
<li>Very common to videotape the subjects</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>QA Involvement with Other Aspects of the Game Business</h3>
<ul>
<li>Usability testing to assist the design the game</li>
<li>Create videotapes of gameplay to company to decide whether to even publish the game</li>
<li>Make screenshots for the game box and advertisements</li>
<li>Presentation: verify and check the game requirements, packaging, manual before the game is shipped and advertised</li>
<li>Work directly with customer support</li>
</ul>

<h3>Best Practices</h3>
<ul>
<li>Integrate testing into the development process</li>
<li>Instead of testing everything at the end, test at certain milestones</li>
<li>Outsource QA:
<ul>
<li>Why: Make sense if QA is "seasonal;" less overhead and personnel to deal with, especially if you are a small game studio</li>
<li>Why not: Takes time to train new people; more expensive to take in specialized and seasoned QA personnel</li>
<li>Make sure that you have a qualified and seasoned pool of QA personnel ready for your use.  One or several in-house QA leads is almost necessary.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Automation:
<ul>
<li>A lot of QA work is mundane</li>
<li>Write scripts to do repeated and mundane tasks</li>
<li>Very efficient, and saves a lot of man-hours</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Write test plans:
<ul>
<li>Define what you are testing</li>
<li>Provide a rubric of expectations to developers</li>
<li>You do not necessarily want to test everything; you do want to test the critical game features</li>
<li>Identify the classes of problems to be tested for a feature</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
