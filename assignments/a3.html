<h2>Assignment 3: Interactive Fiction</h2>
<h2>Due: Thursday, March 13th</h2>
</div>

<h3 class="note">This assignment with worth 20 points, to be done individually.</h3>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Interactive fiction is a genre of text-based games that provides an immersive story.  In interactive fiction games, challenges and puzzles are typically solved conceptually by lateral thinking with discrete and limited choices.  The world is essentially a mathematical graph where each node in the graph is a separate scene.  Unfortunately, players can be dead on arrival, or loop around the world with no end.  Writing a good interactive game requires <span class="stress">planning the entire game world and the story before</span> actual coding of the game.  In this assignment, you will write an interactive fiction game using <a href="http://inform7.com/" target="_blank">Inform 7</a> (<a href="http://inform7.com/" target="_blank">http://inform7.com/</a>), a platform-independent system for playing and writing interactive fiction using <span class="stress">natural language</span>.  It is also one of the most popular languages for writing interactive fiction.</p>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>0. Play the original <span class="title">Zork</span> online at one of the following locations:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://thcnet.net/zork/" target="_blank">http://thcnet.net/zork/</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.ironrealms.com/zork-i-great-underground-adventure" target="_blank">http://www.ironrealms.com/zork-i-great-underground-adventure</a></li>
</ul>
<p>1. Download and install Inform 7 onto your computer or virtual machine at <a href="http://inform7.com/download/" target="_blank">http://inform7.com/download/</a></p>
<p>2. Read the <span class="title">Beginner's Guide to Interactive Fiction with Inform 7/Getting Started with Inform 7</span> at <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Beginner%27s_Guide_to_Interactive_Fiction_with_Inform_7/Getting_Started_with_Inform_7" target="_blank">http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Beginner%27s_Guide_to_Interactive_Fiction_with_Inform_7/Getting_Started_with_Inform_7</a></p>
<p>3. Read the <span class="title">Inform 7 for Programmers</span> at <a href="http://www.ifwiki.org/index.php/Inform_7_for_Programmers" target="_blank">http://www.ifwiki.org/index.php/Inform_7_for_Programmers</a>.  You can also get the PDF version of the guide <a href="Inform_7_for_Programmers.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>4. Write your interactive fiction game.  Your game will be graded on 5 factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Basics - Your game must:
<ol>
<li>Have at least 10 rooms</li>
<li>Use at least 3 doors</li>
<li>Have at least 5 characters, which includes animals, that can be interacted with</li>
<li>Have at least 5 things (or props) that can be interacted with.  Examples: a lantern, a leaflet --both can be examined.</li>
<li>Have at least one way to win the game</li>
<li>Use scoring in some capacity</li>
<li>Use at least one custom action (i.e., a verb)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Functionality (5 points)- Does the game work?  There should not be syntax errors such that the game will crash in the middle of execution.</li>
<li>Complexity (5 points) - The deeper the game, the better.</li>
<li>Design (5 points) - Is the game fun?  Is there good game balance (i.e., not too easy, not too hard)?  Is there a lot of repetition (which is a bad thing)?</li>
<li>Style (5 points) - Spelling and grammar counts; use comments to make notes on your work</li>
</ul>

<h2>Example Game</h2>
<p>See <a href="https://github.com/tuftsdev/GameDevelopment/tree/gh-pages/examples/if" target="_blank">https://github.com/tuftsdev/GameDevelopment/tree/gh-pages/examples/if</a></p>

<h2>Design Considerations</h2>
<p>Please avoid:</p>
<ul>
<li>Puzzles solvable only by trial-and-error.</li>
<li>Illogical spaces.  Example: <span class="title">Legend of Zelda</span> (NES), the second quest.</li>
<li>A game that require outside knowledge.  We are not writing a <span class="title">Carmen Sandiego</span> game here!</li>
</ul>

<h2>Submitting Your Game</h2>
<p>Put your <code>.inform</code> file/folder into a folder named <code>if</code> inside of the private GitHub repo I created for you. Make sure to commit and push to GitHub!</p>
<pre>
# Inside your private GitHub repo folder (e.g., comp23-mchow)
git add .
git commit -m "<span class="stress">Some good commit message</span>"
git push
