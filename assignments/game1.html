    <h1>COMP 23: Introduction to Game Development, Fall 2015</h1>
    <h2>Game Project 1: 2D Game Using HTML5, JavaScript, and Phaser</h2>
    <h3 class="note">This assignment is worth 17% of your overall grade. </h3>
    
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>The web is a thriving ecosystem for games thanks to platforms like Flash, Silverlight, and more recently, the HTML5.  Developers can produce consistent experiences that work on any modern browser, without needing to consider the divergence between operating systems, hardware, and other user-specific concerns.  As such, our first group project will be to use <a href="http://phaser.io/" target="_blank">Phaser</a> to produce a game that runs using HTML5.</p>

    <h2>Expectations</h2>
    <p>We expect every student in this class to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Work effectively in a group of 3-4 contributors</li>
        <li>Use modern agile development practices</li>
        <li>Contribute consistently and impactfully throughout the project</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Requirements</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The game must mix two genres.</li>
        <li>The game must be "tune-able" via JSON.  That is, other people can create custom levels / missions for your team's game.</li>
        <li>The game must have sound. All sound must be chiptune.</li>
        <li>The game must use animated 2D graphics.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Additionally, your game must use two of the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Global scoreboards</li>
        <li>Multiple levels or environments</li>
        <li>Branching storylines</li>
        <li>Realistic or pseudo-realistic 2D physics</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Deliverables</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Proposal, <span class="note">Due Thursday, September 17</span>: This must be handed in on paper in class, one-page maximum typed.</li>
        <li>Game Design Document, <span class="note">Due Tuesday, September 22nd</span>: Very similar to the format of the <a href="gdd.html">One Button Game Design Document (GDD)</a> but with no length restriction and with no business case.</li>
        <li>Alpha Demo, <span class="note">Due Thursday, October 1st</span>: We expect that each team has "something tangible to show for."  It is acceptable for this demo is bug-prone.</li>
        <li>Polished Project 1 Game, <span class="note">Due Thursday, October 8th</span>: The polished version of your team's first game in this class.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>All works and ideas are owned by the members of the team.  We cannot take ownership of any of your work.  We do not have stake or equity in any project created in my classes for that matter.</p>

    <h2>Assessment</h2>
    <p>Your game will be assessment on five factors:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="def">Functionality</span> - We are looking for a game that works and is playable.  Remember, a game with fewer features that work is significantly better than a game with numerous features, where some either do not work or are buggy.</li>
        <li><span class="def">Production</span> - We are looking for a game that is polished (e.g., graphics and sound), consistent (e.g., look-and-feel), and reasonably professional.</li>
        <li><span class="def">Complexity</span> - The more original your game is, the better.  Things that will increase the complexity of your game: realistic collisions, some AI, landscapes, sound, etc.</li>
        <li><span class="def">Game Design</span> - Is your game fun?  Is your user interface easy to understand?  Is there good game balance (i.e., not too easy, not too hard)?</li>
        <li><span class="def">Technical Competency</span> - Use good programming practices, source code in a GitHub repository</li>
    </ul>
