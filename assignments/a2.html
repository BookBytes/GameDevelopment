<h3 class="note">This assignment with worth 15 points, to be done individually.</h3>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Unfortunately in this economy, no employee is indispensable at WageSlaveGames, Inc.  The sole premise of WageSlaveGames, Inc. is to create simple and addicting games for people who love to play computer/video games, but simply do not have the time and money to do so.  The CEO of WageSlaveGames, I.M. Picky need to layoff 75% of the company to make the company more lean and profitable.  To achieve this, he is putting every game designer's job on the line.  How?  Every game designer has to design the next big game: a one-button game.  The best design wins.</p>

<p>You, one of the hapless souls of WageSlaveGames, Inc., have to develop this one-button game.  This game is to be played on <span class="stress">multiple platforms</span>.  Your game can only have one button as the main interaction, displayed on the screen during gameplay along with all game graphics.  By definition, a button has three states: pressed, held, and released.  No control pad, no voice, touch gesture, or accelerometer allowed.</p>

<h3>Assumptions</h3>
<ul>
<li>All devices support sound which you can use.</li>
<li>All devices support networking capability. That is, you can connect to social media websites and APIs.</li>
<li>All devices support bluetooth.</li>
<li>All devices have a camera.</li>
<li>The button has to be stationary on hardware or on screen.</li>
<li>Button does not have any pressure sensitivity.</li>
<li>No voice allowed to communicate or control.</li>
<li>No multitouch.</li>
<li>Platforms may or may not have their own app store, but you can use them.</li>
<li>Advertisements can be supported.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Instructions</h3>
