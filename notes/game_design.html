<h2>Brief History of Video Games; Game Design Principles</h2>

<pre>
* No good Game Dev course can be without a history lesson
* Shed insight on the progress and significant contributions to
video/computer games...
* ...and perhaps will enlighten you
* ...so sit back and enjoy the ride!

The First Computer/Video Game
=============================
1952 - A.S. Douglas of U. Cambridge developed Tic-Tac-Toe for the
Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator (EDSAC), a British
computer.

The 60s
=======
The first games were hacked on oscilloscopes and university mainframes.
1962 - Spacewar. Developed at MIT on a PDP-1 (Programmed Data
Processor-1; Digital Equipment); used vector graphics.
1965 - Periscope. Developed by Sega; popularity prompted Sega to ditch
the pinball business and produce more of its own games. See
http://www.pinrepair.com/arcade/sperisc.htm

The 70s
=======
1971 - Computer Space (a Spacewar clone). Developed by Nolan Bushnell
and Ted Dabney; used a regular raster display television set; too ahead
of its time.
1972 - Magnavox Odyssey. The first home video game console developed by
Ralph Baer. A commercial success ($100 a system, 330,000 sold).
1972 - Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney found Atari.
1972 - Pong, the arcade machine (by Atari). Home version released in
1975.
1974 - Tank. Developed by Kee Games. The first arcade game to use ROM
chips.
1976 - (Colossal Cave) Adventure. The first text-based interactive
fiction game developed by William Crowther and Don Woods on Digital
mainframes.
1976 - Breakout. Prototyped by then Atari employee Steve Jobs (with the
help of friend Steve Wozniak). Jobs "hosed" Wozniak on bonus money from
Atari. Good read:

1977 - Atari 2600 (128 bytes of RAM); Apple introduces the Apple II. 2
million Atari 2600s sold by 1980 --thanks in part to the next game...
1978 - ...Space Invaders. Developed by Taito in Japan.
1979 - Asteroids. Developed by Atari.

The 80s
=======
1980 - Pac-Man. Developed by Namco. Made over $1 billion since its
release.
1980 - Battlezone. Developed by Atari (who was doing $1 billion in
business).
1981 - Many games released: Donkey Kong, Centipede, Ms. Pac-Man,
Galaxian, Tempest.
1982 - Electronic Arts (EA) is founded.
1984 - Apple introduces the Macintosh (birth of the modern computer).
The best-of-times and the worst-of-times: the game industry > $6 billion
in 1981, then Atari sales down 50% in 1981, the game industry < $800
million by 1984.
1985 - Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)
1985 - Tetris. Developed in the Soviet Union.
1986 - Sega Master System, Amiga by Commodore (computer), and Atari
7800.
1989 - Three major products: Sega Genesis (16-bit console), Nintendo
GameBoy, SimCity (developed by Maxis).
What Sega did right for Genesis: EA sports titles.

The 90s: The Start of the Console Wars
======================================
1990 - Super Mario Brothers 3 (NES)
1991 - Super Nintendo (SNES) released. The 16-bit competitor to the Sega
Genesis.
1991 - S3 introduces first single chip graphics accelerator for PC.
1991 - Two major games: Street Fighter II (Capcom) and Wolfenstein 3D
(id Software)
1992 - Goro lives... Mortal Kombat. Developed by Dan Forden, Ed Boon,
and John Tobias at Midway Games.
Nintendo has $7 billion in sales worldwide; Sega and Nintendo consoles
dominate 80% of the computer/video game market.
1993 - Two major games: DOOM (id Software; 2.5D, not true 3D) and Myst
(Broderbund).
1993 - 7th Guest. First game with full-motion video.

<li>Elegant representation (of table tennis in real life)</li>
<li>Social: it takes two to play</li>
<li>Fun</li>
<li>Cool</li>
</ul>

<h3>What is a Game?</h3>
<ul>
<li>What are the differences between a movie and a game?
<ul>
<li>A movie does not require any input from a user; a game does</li>
<li>A movie has a predetermined ending; a game sometimes have no ending, sometimes have one ending, sometimes you can have multiple ways to die</li>
<li>You have to make (interesting) decisions.  There are consequences for all decisions</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What are the differences between a toy and a game?
<ul>
<li>Every game is unique; you face different choices in each game</li>
<li>A game has rules and clearly-defined goals</li>
<li>There may be constraints in a game</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A game has a universe
<ul>
<li>Players</li>
<li>Objects (e.g., vehicles)</li>
<li>Terrains</li>
<li>Behaviors: e.g., physics, sound, speech, emotions</li>

<li>Integration of all the traits above</li>
</ul>

<h3>What is Fun?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Games tap into human motivation systems</li>
<li>Fun = self determination theory</li>
</ul>

<h3>Game Design Principles</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Why should someone else play it?"</li>
<li>Identify the players and the audience</li>
<li>Identify the genre, which may automatically put in place constraints</li>
<li>Identify the universe and landscape</li>
<li>Identify the constraints and goals
<ul>
<li>Determine the criteria for success.  How do you win?  How do you lose?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Determine the rules of interaction
<ul>
<li>Controls; interaction with character, put the player in some environment</li>
<li>How do you explain constraints to the player?  Do you tell a story?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Operational issues (e.g., delivery)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Rules</h3>
<ul>
<li>Semiotics - symbols; sometimes abstract and sometimes have parallels in the real world</li>
<li>Gameplay - the challenges that a player must face to arrive at the objective of the game; the actions that the player is permitted to take to address those challenges</li>
<li>Sequence of play - progression of activities</li>
<li>Goal(s) of the game - the objective of the game</li>
<li>Termination condition - a.k.a, victory conditions, a.k.a., end-game</li>
<li>Metarules - rules about the rules</li>
</ul>

<h3>Common Goals in Games</h3>
<ul>
<li>Beat the final boss</li>
<li>Save the princess</li>
<li>Capture the king, the country, flag, etc.</li>
<li>Save the world</li>
<li>Beat your opponent, the other guy</li>
<li>Get the highest score</li>
<li>Complete all the levels</li>
<li>Build the best {fill in the blanks} without going bankrupt</li>
<li>Sandboxing; play God (a.k.a., "wuss" mode)</li>
<li>Achieve something (e.g., reunite the Triforce)</li>
<li>Grab a lot of grub</li>
<li>Get the most kills</li>
<li>Kill everything that moves</li>
<li>Be the last man standing</li>
<li>Don't die</li>
<li>Beat the clock; don't run out of time</li>
<li>Character building</li>
<li>Build relationships</li>
<li>Solve a puzzle</li>
<li>Level up</li>
<li>Make the right choices (well, try not to screw up)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Designing the Gameplay: Making the Fun Happen</h3>
<ul>
<li>Some skill or strategy involved</li>
<li>Feeling of accomplishment</li>
<li>Immersion: you are living a different life, or something that you wish you were</li>
<li>Anticipation: do I look forward to playing this?  Can this pass time?  Sometimes addiction.</li>
<li>Replay value</li>
<li>A good story</li>
<li>Believable story</li>
<li>Good production</li>
<li>Real-world feel</li>
<li>Bug-free</li>

<li>Not too linear</li>
<li>Game balance</li>
<li>Competition</li>
<li>Well, is it suitable for certain people?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Core Mechanics</h3>
<ul>
<li>Determines how the game actually operates</li>
<li>Consist of data and algorithms that precisely define the game's rules and internal operations</li>
<li>Should be so precisely stated that the programmers can write the code</li>
<li>Its functions:
<ul>
<li>Operate the internal economy of the game</li>
<li>Present active challenges</li>
<li>Accept player actions</li>
<li>Detect victory or loss</li>
<li>Operate the artificial intelligence</li>
<li>Switch the game from mode to mode</li>
<li>Transmit triggers to the storytelling engine</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Designing Core Mechanics</h3>
<ul>
<li>Keep it simple and elegant</li>
<li>Look for patterns, then generalize</li>
<li>Don't strive for perfection (on paper)</li>
<li>Refinement is important</li>
</ul>

<h3>What are the rules and core mechanics of <span class="title">Monopoly</span>?</h3>

<h3>Game Balance</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fairness (start symmetrical: equal resources and powers to all)</li>
<li>Asymmetrical</li>
<li>Challenges vs. success</li>
<li>Meaningful choices: low risk / low reward, high risk / high reward</li>
<li>Short vs. long</li>
<li>Rewards</li>
<li>Punishment</li>
</ul>

<h3>Feedback</h3>
<ul>
<li>What happens when you win?</li>
<li>What if you lose?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Uh oh.....Game Design and Gameplay Blunders</h3>
<ul>

<li>The unfinished or rushed game.  The consequences:
<ul>
<li>Overworked developers</li>
<li>Bad testing; bugs galore</li>
<li>Doesn't sell well</li>
<li>Players get pissed</li>
<li>Patch /update hell</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I need the CD to play this game?</li>
<li>False promise (a.k.a., Duke Nukem Forever)
<ul>
<li>Not as good as advertised</li>
<li>WHAT?  I HAVE TO PAY FOR THIS PLUGIN IN THE GAME?!?!?!?!</li>
</ul>
