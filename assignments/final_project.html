<h1>Introduction to Game Development</h1>
<h2>Final Project</h2>
</div>
<h2 class="note">A brief project proposal must be submitted via email by Monday, April 7th at 11:59 PM.</h2>

<h2 class="note">ABSOLUTE DEADLINE: Monday, Cinco de Mayo at 5 PM</h2>

<p>Your final project is an opportunity to "think big."  Make the most out of collegiate academic experience.  Most importantly, leverage your creativity and have lots fun.  I expect that your final project will be of similar complexity as your 2D game development project.  I also encourage that you work in a group (of no more than 3 people per group). The project is largely up to you and your teammate, but three caveats:</p>

<ol>
<li>The game must be <span class="stress">playable</span> on an Android or iOS device.</li>
<li>The game must run in fullscreen-mode.</li>
<li>A web page or website must accompany your game.</li>
</ol>

<h2>The Website</h2>
<p>There must be a web page that details your game (e.g., objectives, instructions).  Most of the past projects showcased above are good examples.  You can host the web page and your game on your personal web space on Tufts CS or use <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.  Hosting your game on GitHub has many benefits.  Many features are provided for free such as revision control (duh), issues tracking, simple web hosting, and even a wiki.  It is an avenue for others to learn from your development efforts.  The source code should be made publicly available, unless you have a good reason not to do so.  On the main web page, please make sure to list the people who worked on the project!</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~jkraemer/SeniorProject/index.html" target="_blank">My friend and former classmate James Kraemer's senior project from spring 2002.</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.alexbmiller.net/rocketjump.php" target="_blank"><span class="title">Rocket Jump</span> by Alex Miller (Spring 2012)</a></li>
<li><a href="http://roygbivthegame.webs.com/" target="_blank"><span class="title">ROYGBIV</span> by Rob Apelian, Jillian Silver, Cole Zuber, Jon Dutko (Spring 2012)</a></li>
<li><a href="http://gsiu.github.io/50GDFinalProject/" target="_blank"><span class="title">Sky High</span> by Amanda Bell, Tolga Zeybek, Gabriel Siu (Spring 2012)</a></li>
<li><a href="http://bcjordan.com/sprayplay/" target="_blank"><span class="title">Spray Play</span> by Brian Jordan (Spring 2012)</a></li>
<li><a href="http://mgold.github.io/Packets/" target="_blank"><span class="title">Virus</span> by Max Goldstein and Eva Parish (Spring 2012)</a></li>
</ol>

<h2>Development Kits and Options</h2>
<ol>
<li>Android: <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html" target="_blank">Android SDK</a> (requires knowledge of Java), HTML5</li>
<li>Apple iOS: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/" target="_blank">iOS SDK</a> (requires knowledge of Objective-C), HTML5
<ul>
<li>Email me to be a part of the University's iOS Developer Program in order to test your game on a device.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<h2>Submitting Your Final Project</h2>
<ul>
<li class="stress">Send me an e-mail with a link to your web page or website, perferably on GitHub.  I will download or clone the source of your game from your website.</li>
<li class="note"><strong>I will not accept attachments!</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>No design document necessary for your final project as your web page or website will replace it.</li>
<li>Many past final projects are showcased at <a href="http://tuftsdev.github.io/GameDevelopment/history/index.html" target="_blank">http://tuftsdev.github.io/GameDevelopment/history/index.html</a></li>
<li>There is a way to port a game written in Python with Pygame to Android: see <a href="http://pygame.renpy.org/" target="_blank">http://pygame.renpy.org/</a>.  However, I have personally never tried it out.</li>
