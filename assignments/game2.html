        <h1>Introduction to Game Development</h1>
        <h2>Group Assignment 2: Unity and Mobile</h2>
        <h2>Due: Tuesday, December 15 at Noon</h2>
    </div>
    <!--<h3 class="note">This assignment is worth 18% of your overall grade.</h3>-->
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
    Due to the complexity involved in developing games, game engines have become standard in the video game industry. 
    By providing an intuitive interface and comprehensive layers of abstraction, game designers and developers can focus on the important parts of development. 
    <span class="stress">
        For our second project, we will use the <a href="http://unity3d.com">Unity Engine</a> to produce games that can run on any platform and with a variety of control schemes. 
    </span>
    
    </p>
    <h2>Expectations</h2>
    <p>We expect every student in this class to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Work effectively in a group of 3-4 contributors</li>
        <li>Use modern agile development practices</li>
        <li>Contribute consistently and impactfully throughout the project</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Requirements</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The game can use either 2D or 3D graphics.</li> 
        <li>The game must have multiple scenes.</li>
        <li>The game must have sound effects and music.</li>
        <li>The game shall be designed to be mobile-first (that is, playable on a mobile device).</li>
        <li>The game shall have a website as part of final deliverable.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Additionally, each project must use one of the following (extra credit for more than one)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Networked or local multiplyaer</li>
        <li>Particle effects</li>
        <li>Multiple cameras</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="note">Note: the list of "pick two" items is subject to additions.</p>

    <h2>Deliverables</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Game Design Document - <span class="note">Due in class on Tuesday, Tuesday, November 3rd</span></li>
        <li>Digital Game Prototype - <span class="note">Due in class on Thursday, November 12th</span></li>
        <li>Alpha Demo, Iteration 1 - <span class="note">Due in class on Thursday, November 19th</span>.  Must Unity.</li>
        <li>Alpha Demo, Iteration 2 - <span class="note">Due in class on Thursday, December 3rd</span></li>
        <li>Beta with Test Plan - <span class="note">Due in class on Thursday, December 10th</span></li>
        <li>"Gold" Game with Website - <span class="note">Due at Noon, Tuesday, December 15</span></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>The Test Plan</h2>
    <p>This document will be distributed to all students (a.k.a., players) in the class, <span class="stress">one page maximum.</span>  This document shall have the following sections:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Game title (duh!)</li>
        <li>Authors (your name; duh!)</li>
        <li>Description of game in 255 words or less</li>
        <li>Brief instructions (rules)</li>
        <li>Controls (for every control scheme in your game)</li>
        <li>A checklist of at least 5 tasks that you want the player to test with a section for comments.  Briefly describe each task with proper outcome.  Example: press [an object or overlay] 5 times =&gt; produces a special move</li>
        <li>Section for additional comments and suggestions</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>The Website</h2>
    <p>There must be a web page that details your game (e.g., objectives, instructions).  Most of the past projects showcased above are good examples.  You can host the web page and your game on your personal web space on Tufts CS or use <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.  Hosting your game on GitHub has many benefits.  Many features are provided for free such as revision control (duh), issues tracking, simple web hosting, and even a wiki.  It is an avenue for others to learn from your development efforts.  The source code should be made publicly available, unless you have a good reason not to do so.  On the main web page, please make sure to list the people who worked on the project!</p>
    <p>Examples:</p>
        <ol>
        <li><a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~jkraemer/SeniorProject/index.html" target="_blank">My friend and former classmate James Kraemer's senior project from spring 2002.</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://www.alexbmiller.net/rocketjump.php" target="_blank"><span class="title">Rocket Jump</span> by Alex Miller (Spring 2012)</a></li>
